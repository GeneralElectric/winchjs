      <p>I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I have a dark side, too. Hello, Dexter Morgan.</p>

      <h2>Born Free</h2>

      <p>I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. Somehow, I
        doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.</li>
        <li>Keep your mind limber.</li>
        <li>I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely.
          With my
          own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>See-Through</h3>

      <p>Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. You're a killer. I catch
        killers. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my
        world
        and I could see. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. You look&hellip;perfect. I will
        not
        kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.</p>
      <h4>Hungry Man</h4>

      <p>Keep your mind limber. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something
        new
        entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm
        neither man
        nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. This man is a knight
        in
        shining armor. I'm really more an apartment person.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.</li>
        <li>Tell him time is of the essence.</li>
        <li>I'm really more an apartment person.</li>
        <li>I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.</li>
      </ol>
      <h5>Seeing Red</h5>

      <p>Like a sloth. I can do that. Keep your mind limber. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told
        anyone before. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. You're a killer. I catch killers. I'm
        Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.</p>

      <p>I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask &hellip; not just me. I'm generally
        confused most of the time. He taught me a code. To survive. He taught me a code. To survive. Like a
        sloth. I
        can do that. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.</p>

      <p>You're a killer. I catch killers. You're a killer. I catch killers. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I
        think
        he's got a crush on you, Dex!</p>

      <p>You look&hellip;perfect. This man is a knight in shining armor. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm
        partial to air conditioning. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a
        client.</p>

      <p>I'm partial to air conditioning. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I think he's got a crush on you,
        Dex!</p>

      <p>I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Like a sloth. I can do that. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a
        piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a
        compliment. This man is a knight in shining armor.</p>

      <p>Cops, another community I'm not part of. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone
        before.
        Tell him time is of the essence.</p>

      <p>Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. I have a dark side, too. I'm
        going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. God created pudding, and then he rested.
        I'm
        thinking two circus clowns dancing. You?</p>

      <p>Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating
        to
        others. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should
        be.</p>

      <p>I'm really more an apartment person. Only you could make those words cute. Tell him time is of the
        essence.
        I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.</p>

      <p>You're a killer. I catch killers. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the
        people
        around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. Makes me a &hellip; scientist.</p>

        <p>I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I have a dark side, too. Hello, Dexter Morgan.</p>

        <h2>Born Free</h2>

        <p>I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. Somehow, I

            With my

        <p>Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. You're a killer. I catch
          killers. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my
          world
          and I could see. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. You look&hellip;perfect. I will
          not
          kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.</p>
        <h4>Hungry Man</h4>

        <p>Keep your mind limber. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something
          new
          entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm
          neither
          man
          nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. This man is a knight
          in
          shining armor. I'm really more an apartment person.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.</li>

        <h5>Seeing Red</h5>

        <p>Like a sloth. I can do that. Keep your mind limber. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told
          anyone before. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. You're a killer. I catch killers. I'm
          Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.</p>

        <p>I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask &hellip; not just me. I'm generally
          confused most of the time. He taught me a code. To survive. He taught me a code. To survive. Like a
          sloth. I
          can do that. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.</p>

        <p>You're a killer. I catch killers. You're a killer. I catch killers. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I
          think
          he's got a crush on you, Dex!</p>

        <p>You look&hellip;perfect. This man is a knight in shining armor. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm
          partial to air conditioning. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a
          client.</p>

        <p>I'm partial to air conditioning. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I think he's got a crush on you,
          Dex!</p>

        <p>I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Like a sloth. I can do that. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a
          piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a
          compliment. This man is a knight in shining armor.</p>

        <p>Cops, another community I'm not part of. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone
          before.
          Tell him time is of the essence.</p>

        <p>Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. I have a dark side, too. I'm
          going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. God created pudding, and then he rested.
          I'm
          thinking two circus clowns dancing. You?</p>

        <p>Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating
          to
          others. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should
          be.</p>

        <p>I'm really more an apartment person. Only you could make those words cute. Tell him time is of the
          essence.
          I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.</p>

        <p>You're a killer. I catch killers. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the
          people
          around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. Makes me a &hellip; scientist.</p>
